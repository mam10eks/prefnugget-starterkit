# PrefNugget AutoJudge

Nugget-based LLM judge implementations for evaluating RAG systems, as described in our paper ["Too Many Questions?"](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/too-many-questions/).

Built on the [TREC AutoJudge](https://trec-auto-judge.cs.unh.edu/) framework.

## Setup

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the package (editable mode)
uv pip install -e .

# Optional: install evaluation tools for local meta-evaluation
uv pip install -e ".[evaluate]"
```

### LLM Configuration

Set environment variables:
```bash
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export CACHE_DIR="./cache"  # optional, enables prompt caching
```

Or use a config file: `auto-judge run --llm-config llm-config.yml ...`

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run a judge variant against a dataset
auto-judge run \
    --workflow judges/prefnugget/workflow.yml \
    --variant iter20bothties-few \
    --rag-responses /path/to/responses/ \
    --rag-topics /path/to/topics.jsonl \
    --out-dir ./output/

# Run against the included kiddie test dataset
auto-judge run \
    --workflow judges/prefnugget/workflow.yml \
    --variant iter20bothties-few \
    --rag-responses data/kiddie/runs/repgen/ \
    --rag-topics data/kiddie/topics/kiddie-topics.jsonl \
    --out-dir ./output-kiddie/
```

Or run the included smoke test script which also does meta-evaluation: `bash run_kiddie.sh`

This produces three files in the output directory:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `<variant>.eval.txt` | Leaderboard scores (upload this for meta-evaluation) |
| `<variant>.nuggets.jsonl` | Extracted nugget banks |
| `<variant>.config.yml` | Resolved configuration snapshot |

## Judge Variants

All judges share a three-phase architecture: (1) rank responses, (2) extract nugget questions, (3) grade responses against nuggets. Variants differ in how nuggets are extracted.

## Pseudocode

### Phase 1: Pairwise Preference Elicitation

```
for each topic:
    pairs = stratified_sample(responses, num_others=4)
    for (resp_A, resp_B) in pairs:
        winner  = LLM(PrefJudgment, passage_1=A, passage_2=B)
        winner2 = LLM(PrefJudgment, passage_1=B, passage_2=A)  # swapped
        record results; drop ties
    borda[resp] = wins - losses
    rank responses by borda score (best first)
```

### Phase 2a: PrefNugget -- Contrastive Nugget Extraction

```
for each topic:
    questions = []
    pairs = winner_loser_pairs sorted by borda(winner) + 0.99*borda(loser) desc
    for (winner, loser) in pairs[:100], taken 2 per topic per batch:
        if len(questions) >= 20: stop
        new_qs = LLM(IterativeExtractDifferentiatingNuggets,
                      winner_passage, loser_passage,
                      given_exam_questions=questions)[:2]   # max 2 new per pair
        questions += deduplicate(new_qs)
    nugget_bank[topic] = questions[:20]
```

### Phase 2b: GroundedNugget -- Single-Response Extraction

```
for each topic:
    questions = []
    responses sorted by borda score (best first)
    for response in responses[:100], taken 2 per topic per batch:
        if len(questions) >= 20: stop
        new_qs = LLM(GroundedIterativeNuggets,
                      response_passage=response,
                      given_exam_questions=questions)[:2]   # max 2 new per response
        questions += deduplicate(new_qs)
    nugget_bank[topic] = questions[:20]
```

### Phase 2c: QueryOnlyNugget -- Parametric Generation

```
for each topic:
    questions = LLM(IterativeGenerateNuggetQuestionsReportRequest,
                     query_title, query_background, query_problem)
    nugget_bank[topic] = deduplicate(questions)[:20]
```

### Phase 3: Response Grading

```
for each (response, nugget_question) in responses x nugget_bank[topic]:

    if grading == "response":
        grade = LLM(GradeNuggetAnswer,
                     question=nugget_question,
                     passage=response.text)                   # -> 0-5

    elif grading == "document_paragraphs":
        for paragraph in response.cited_documents.paragraphs:
            g = LLM(GradeNuggetAnswer,
                     question=nugget_question,
                     passage=paragraph)
        grade = max(g for all paragraphs)                     # best paragraph wins

    nugget_grades[response][nugget] = grade

# Aggregate per response
MAX_GRADE = max(grade for all nuggets)
```

## Prompt Definitions

### Phase 1: Preference Judging (`PrefJudgment`)

> You are a highly experienced and accurate assessor for TREC.
>
> Select the passage that answers the query better. Just answer 1 or 2, without any explanation or extra verbiage.
> If both passages are similar, select the simplest and clearest.

| Direction | Field | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In | `query_title` | Query title |
| In | `query_background` | Background context for the query |

> Avoid generic quality questions. Make questions self-contained (e.g., "Capital of France?" not "The capital?").

| Direction | Field | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In | `query_title` | Query title |

### Phase 2c: Query-Only Nugget Generation (`IterativeGenerateNuggetQuestionsReportRequest`)

> For a query as title, problem statement, and user background, imagine a good RAG response. Focus on relevance, correctness, completeness. Generate brief, atomic questions that target query-essential information which a good response should answer well.
>
> Avoid generic quality questions. Make questions self-contained (e.g., "Capital of France?" not "The capital?").

| Direction | Field | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In | `query_title` | Query title |
| In | `query_background` | Background context for the query |
| In | `query_problem` | Problem statement to be addressed |

> - 5: The answer is highly relevant, complete, and accurate.
> - 4: The answer is mostly relevant and complete but may have minor gaps or inaccuracies.
> - 3: The answer is partially relevant and complete, with noticeable gaps or inaccuracies.
> - 2: The answer has limited relevance and completeness, with significant gaps or inaccuracies.
> - 1: The answer is minimally relevant or complete, with substantial shortcomings.
> - 0: The answer is not relevant or complete at all.

| Direction | Field | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In | `question` | The question to be answered |
| In | `passage` | The passage that may contain the answer |
| Out | `grade` | Grade 0--5 |
| Out | `reasoning` | Brief explanation of the grade |
| Out | `confidence` | Score 0.0--1.0 |

## Meta-Evaluation

### Local meta-evaluation (on kiddie)

Requires `uv pip install -e ".[evaluate]"` (see [Setup](#setup)).

```bash
auto-judge-evaluate meta-evaluate \
    --truth-leaderboard data/kiddie/eval/kiddie_fake.eval.ir_measures.txt \
    --truth-format ir_measures --truth-header \
    --eval-format tot \
    --on-missing default \
    output-kiddie/iter20bothties-few.eval.txt
```

### Meta-evaluation service

To evaluate against a real TREC dataset, upload your `<variant>.eval.txt` file to the [TREC AutoJudge meta-evaluation service](https://trec-auto-judge.cs.unh.edu/).

### Local meta-evaluation (on your own data)

```bash
auto-judge-evaluate meta-evaluate \
    --truth-leaderboard /path/to/truth.eval.ir_measures.txt \
    --truth-format ir_measures --truth-header \
    --eval-format tot \
    --on-missing default \
    output/*.eval.txt
```
